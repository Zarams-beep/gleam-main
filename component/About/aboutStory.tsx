            Gleam started with one small compliment that changed an entire
            team's day. We realized that kindness was contagious and that
            workplaces were missing a simple way to spread it.
          </p>
          <p>
            That realization sparked something deeper. What if anonymous
            positivity could be the secret to healthier teams, better
            communication, and happier people?
